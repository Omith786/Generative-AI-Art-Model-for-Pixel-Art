# Generative-AI-Art-Model-for-Pixel-Art

This project uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create original pixel art sprites. The goal was to take a technology often associated with photorealistic images and apply it to a very different medium: low-resolution, heavily stylised visuals inspired by retro games. By training the GAN on collections of pixel art, the model learns how to reproduce the charm of 8-bit and 16-bit aesthetics while still producing entirely new designs.

One of the most interesting aspects of this work is that the limitations become strengths. Working with small grids and restricted palettes forces the generator to be creative in ways that large-scale image models don’t encounter. The results feel playful and nostalgic, resembling sprites that could easily belong in a classic RPG or platformer. It’s a reminder that AI isn’t only about realism — sometimes it’s about imagination within constraints.

The model architecture is designed with simplicity in mind, so others can follow along and experiment with their own datasets. Training was focused on stability, as GANs are notoriously difficult to balance, but with careful tuning, the system produces outputs that capture both variety and coherence.

In the end, this project shows how machine learning can be more than a technical exercise. It becomes a tool for creativity, offering a way to automatically generate assets that can inspire or even be used directly in game development.
